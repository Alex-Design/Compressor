# Compressor
Reads a text-based (.txt, .xml, .php, etc) file as a string, compresses it and outputs the result into a new file.

## Usage
- Download the repository by clicking "clone or download" on the top right, and place it wherever you like.
- Next, open the terminal and type **cd yourfilelocation** where yourfilelocation is where the repository is located.
- Place the (text-oriented) files you wish to compress, into the FilesToCompress folder. (Files within subfolders are ok.)
- Finally, type **php compressor.php** into the terminal and press enter.

_Optional argument: overwrite_

_To use, type: **php compressor.php overwrite** into the terminal._

- The result will be output in the CompressedFiles folder.

## Upcoming Features
- Recursion
- Testing to check suitability for reading multiple different types of files (only text-based files are currently supported eg .js, .php, .xml, .txt, etc)
